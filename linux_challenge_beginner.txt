1.  
In order to create the random lines, I've created a string including all the alphabetical characters and the digits.  
Then I took one of this string's character randomly.
To do so, I used the RANDOM function, which I restricted to the range 0 - 59 using modulo. That gave me an index where I extracted the "randomly" character from the string. 

2. 
To know the size of a file, one could use ls -l or du. I prefered du because it was simpler to separate the size of the rest of the output of this command (by means of cut).

3.  
To sort the file, I just used the sort command, without options. It sorts the file according to the first character of each line.

5.
To count the lines which were removed, I used the diff command, combined with wc -l.
